### Implemented using:
> JavaScript, Express, MongoDB, Node.js, REST API, AWS, Docker, Angular, Bootstrap

### What is it?
> Show Me A Table Topic is a fully-responsive web application built for my Toastmasters club (Toastmasters is a public speaking organization). In Toastmasters meetings, a Table Topics Master gives attendees topics for them to talk for 1-2 minutes. Show Me A Table Topic is a place where its Table Topics Masters can find inspirations on topics as well as contribute.

### Why did I make it?
> Table Topics was one of my favorite Toastmasters meeting sections. I was Table Topics Master quite a few times. I wanted to use good topics to inspire speakers. But, it’s hard to think of good ones. Sometimes, I ended up spending a lot of time finding one that works well for our meeting theme. I thought that would be great if there’s a website that I can practice table topic and find table topic ideas. So, now I built this website to gather good Table Topics and ideas from people. I hope these topics will give others some inspirations for practicing public speech skill and hosting the next Table Topics.

### Implementation

- I developed this website using Javascript on Node.js platform, and deployed on AWS with Docker.
- Frontend: Angular, Bootstrap
- Server: Express
- NoSQL Database: MongoDB
